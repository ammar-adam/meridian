## What is Meridian

Meridian is a thesis-native deal screening system for investment firms.
Configure your fund once, then Discover companies against your mandate,
Brief them into forwardable one-pagers, and learn from every edit and pursue/pass.

Brief output targets mandate-specific thesis bands — structured one-pagers investment teams can forward.

The value prop is deal velocity. Not saving analyst time. Letting a fund look
at 3x more companies per week without adding headcount.

## Product Loop

```
Fund setup (/fund/setup) → Discover → Brief → Library → Thesis
```

| Workspace | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Discover** | `/discover` | Thesis → PitchBook + Perplexity → ranked companies |
| **Brief** | `/brief` | URL → scrape → research → one-page brief |
| **Library** | `/library` | Saved briefs with outcomes |
| **Thesis** | `/thesis` | Pursue rate, thesis corrections, fund learning |
| **Fund** | `/fund` | Fund profile (thesis, portfolio, branding) |

Legacy redirects: `/source` → `/discover`, `/app` → `/brief`, `/insights` → `/thesis`

---

## Architecture Layers

| Layer | Route | Pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 Brief** | `/brief` | URL → scrape → research → memo |
| **L2 Discover** | `/discover` | Thesis → PitchBook + Perplexity → ranked companies → batch brief |
| **L3 Thesis** | `/memo` + `/thesis` | Inline edits, pursue/pass → behavioral learning |

---

## Fund Profile (firm-agnostic)

Stored in `localStorage` via `lib/fund-profile.js`. Required before workspace use.
Auto-enrich via `/api/fund-enrich` (scrape fund site + Perplexity + Claude).

No hardcoded fund branding.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 app router + Tailwind |
| Scraping | Native fetch + regex, server-side |
| Research | Perplexity API (sonar-deep-research for briefs, sonar for discover) |
| Synthesis | Anthropic API (claude-sonnet-4) |
| Sourcing | PitchBook API (optional) + Perplexity + Claude ranking |
| Template | HTML with {{VARIABLE}} string replace |
| PDF | Browser print (Playwright TODO) |

## Key Rules for Agents

**Never do these:**
- Do not hardcode fund-specific branding (no Sagard defaults in runtime paths)
- Do not use client-side fetch for scraping
- Do not hardcode API keys in source
- Do not install Cheerio, Puppeteer, or scraping libraries
- Do not touch memo-template.html CSS unless visually broken

**Always do these:**
- Memo page renders at exactly 210mm wide
- Fund profile required for Discover/Brief (gate via FundGate)
- Thread sourceContext from Discover through to /api/generate
- `/memo` shows empty state when sessionStorage has no brief
- Log API responses during development

## Current Build Status

- [x] V1: URL → memo pipeline
- [x] V2: Quality gates, parallel pipeline, memo library, industry hero fallback
- [x] V3: Behavioral tracking, pursue/pass, thesis dashboard
- [x] Thesis-first rebuild: Discover/Brief/Thesis nav, fund profile, batch briefing
- [ ] Playwright PDF route (TODO in app/api/generate/route.js)

## Definition of Done

1. Fresh install → fund setup → Discover run → no hardcoded fund strings
2. Brief from Discover carries search thesis into memo thesis band
3. Batch brief 3+ companies without leaving Discover
4. Thesis tab shows pursue rate after outcomes logged
